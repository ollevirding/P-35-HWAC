| Week 46 | Startup meeting with Stefan and Erik.           |     Researching MIP and continuing to work on the intrudoctory MiniZinc course.        |      Researching MIP and continuing to work on the intrudoctory MiniZinc course.       |      Meeting at Ericsson and introduction to the problem and its' domain. | Starting to read the documentation of the code provided by Erik and getting Github working.            |       1. What progress was made during the week and what issues remain? Veckan kan sammanfattas av mycket förarbete för att lära sig området, dvs. Minizinc, MILP och Gurobi. Vi hade uppstartsmöte samt ett möte med Ericsson om problem domänet samt blivit tilldelad dokumentation för den existerande modellen. Kvarstående problem är att tillgång till källkod ännu inte är möjligt. 2. What is the aim for next week? Fortsatt fördjupning i MILP-modellering samt gå igenom existerande dokumentation rigoröst och skapa en djupare förståelse för problemet. Fokus är att skapa en förståelse av inputs och constraints för att eventuellt börja skissa på en modell. Om tiden tillåter även att skissa upp en implementering i AMPL. 3. If applicable: any further division of task agreed upon.      |
| Week 47 |             |      Read through the HWAC MiniZinc Model Manual       |      Meeting with Erik. Went through questions we had from tuesday's session. The meeting lead to a few more questions that was answered through email    |     Recieved news that our computers are finally available for pickup on monday (25 nov)        |             |      1.

| Week 48 |      We received our Ericsson computers! The day was spent setting up the computer and acquiring all programs and performing neccessary steps to get everything working properly.      |             |      Planning meeting with group. A working plan was setup and an initial goal for the week of creating a python script that launches AMPL with all the neccessary data was decided. Some more setup work was done.       |      Working on the python script and figuring out all preprocessing steps of provided data.        |      Same work as yesterday. Great progress was done! A working although incomplete script was formed.       |             |
| Week 49 |       Poster presentatio nseminar. Started declaring constraints in the code.      |     Presentation preparation (Individual work)       |      Coding - still bugs and errors       |      Coding - still bugs and errors        |       Presentation technique seminar. Debugging of code. Managed to get working code with feasible solutions. Created the report latex file and wrote the abstract.       |             |
| Week 50 | Oral presentation training with Kristina and Stefan and debugging of code. Got a first working version! Slight errors and complete model not yet implemented.       | Added rest of constraints to complete model and debugging to get all constraints working properly. Result was a complete and working model!| Meeting with Eric was had to showcase our model and determine what can be included in report. A meeting was had afterwards with only Love, Olle and Alex where we decided on a plan on what to write in report.|       Touching up the code to look better and better structure as well as writing on report.      |      Same as yesterday.      |      Same as yesterday.      |
| Week 51 |    Refactor of code structure. Report writing         |     Benchmark script. Report writing         |       Benchmark script  Report writing   |    Report writing        |      Report writing       |             |
